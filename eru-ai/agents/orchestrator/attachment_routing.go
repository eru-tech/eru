// Attaching a file is an instruction.
//
// Nobody attaches a screenshot in passing. It is there because the answer
// depends on it, and a plan that does not hand it to any step has decided,
// silently, that it does not matter - which is not a decision the user asked for
// and not one they can see being made. What they see is an assistant that
// looked straight past the thing they pointed at.
//
// Forwarding costs a step the tokens to carry the file, so the rule is not that
// every step should get it. The rule is that SOME step should: whichever one has
// to look at the thing. Deciding which is the planner's judgement about the
// task, and this only insists that the judgement is made rather than skipped.

// A sub-agent's question is not automatically a question for the user.
//
// When a step pauses to ask something, the orchestrator used to hand it straight
// on. Much of the time that is the orchestrator making its own homework the
// user's problem: "which entity holds transactions", "what is the field code for
// rating", "what was that label before I changed it" all have answers, and they
// are in the run's own results, in the conversation, or one read-only lookup
// away. Asking for them is slower than finding them and teaches the user that
// the assistant does not pay attention.
//
// What must still be asked is anything the system cannot know. "Chart or table",
// "include archived rows", "which of these three layouts" are not facts to be
// looked up; they are the user's intent, and a confident guess at intent is
// worse than a question, because a question is visible and a wrong assumption
// usually is not. The costs are not symmetric: an unnecessary question costs a
// few seconds, a silent wrong assumption costs work that has to be found and
// undone later.
//
// So the resolver answers questions of fact, from evidence it can cite, and
// refers everything else - including anything it is merely unsure about - to the
// user. It runs once. A resolution that would itself need a question is a
// question for the user.

// resolvedAnswer is one question the orchestrator answered for itself.

const resolverSystemPrompt = `You are deciding which of a set of questions can be answered from what is already known, and which genuinely need the user.

Answer a question yourself ONLY when both hold:
  1. It is a question of FACT about this system or this conversation - the name of an entity or field, a value that was used earlier, whether something exists, what a page currently contains.
  2. You can point at where the answer came from: a step result below, something earlier in this conversation, or a lookup you ran with the tools available.

Send a question to the user when ANY of these hold:
  - It asks what the user WANTS: a choice of layout, chart type, wording, styling, which records to include, whether to proceed.
  - It is a matter of taste or judgement rather than fact.
  - You cannot find the answer, or you found something that only resembles an answer.
  - You are not certain.

Being unsure is a perfectly good outcome; say so and let the user answer. A question costs them a few seconds. A confident wrong answer costs them work they have to find and undo, and they may not notice it happened at all. Never invent a plausible value to avoid asking, and never answer from what would be a reasonable default - a default is a preference, not a fact.

Use the lookup tools when they would settle a factual question. Then call structured_output with one resolution per question.`

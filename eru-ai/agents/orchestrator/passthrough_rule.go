// When the whole plan is one agent step that reads nothing from any other step,
// the orchestrator has nothing to add and everything to lose by rewriting the
// user's message.
//
// What happened without this: the user said "change the bg color of this comp
// with id tb-title to blue", and then "blue is not looking gd, lets change it to
// yellow". The planner turned the second message into its own self-contained
// instruction - "replace all blue colors with yellow throughout the page" - and
// the page agent, which had the earlier turn in its own conversation and would
// have resolved "blue" to tb-title, instead obeyed the instruction it was given,
// scanned the whole page and changed three components.
//
// The orchestrator sees one message. The agent sees the conversation and the
// page. So the message goes through as the user wrote it.

// singleAgentStep returns the only agent step in a plan, when there is exactly
// one and nothing else runs alongside it.

// judgeQuality runs the gate for one attempt.
//
// It is called only on an answer that has already passed every conformance
// check, so a verdict here is about taste, not correctness. The return says
// whether a verdict was reached at all; whether it costs an attempt is carried
// on the verdict itself as Enforced.
//
// Three refusals are deliberate, and each one is a way this gate could have
// become worse than no gate:
//
//   - An agent type with no judge is left entirely alone. The gate is opt-in.
//   - A judge that errors leaves the answer alone. A check that could not run
//     must never read as a check that failed; that is the same reason the eval
//     has a BLOCKED state distinct from FAIL.
//   - A poor verdict with nothing to say is recorded and not enforced. Feeding
//     "not good enough" back with no named fault spends an attempt to ask the
//     model to guess what it did wrong.

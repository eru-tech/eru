// Holding an agent to what it says it did.
//
// # The failure
//
// An agent finishes and reports: "created the entity, added six fields, saved
// the page." The report is well formed, every schema check passes, and three of
// those things never happened. The model is not lying so much as summarising an
// intention - it planned six fields, wrote four, and described the plan.
//
// Nothing catches this. Validation reads the report's SHAPE; the report's
// CONTENT is a claim about the world, and the only thing that can test it is the
// record of what the agent actually did.
//
// processo_builder has had a version of this for months - confirmWrites, written
// by hand, for one agent, checking one kind of claim. This is the same idea with
// the agent taken out: a claim in the answer names an action, and the framework
// asks the tool record whether that action ran with those arguments.
//
// # Why it reports rather than rejects, by default
//
// A claim that cannot be matched is not proof of a lie. The tool record misses
// calls made inside a sub-agent's own loop; an action can be named differently
// in the report than in the call; work can genuinely have been done by a path
// that leaves no record. Failing a run on that evidence would make the framework
// wrong more often than the agent. Declared as an error-severity rule it will
// reject; left as quality it marks down, which is the right default for a check
// whose evidence is incomplete.

// ClaimRule says that a value in the answer must correspond to something the
// agent actually did.

	// Claims is a dotted path to the claimed things - "created_fields",
	// "report.entities". Each string found there is one claim.
	Claims string `json:"claims" eru:"required"`
	// Action is the tool action that would have to have run for a claim to be
	// true.
	Action string `json:"action" eru:"required"`

	// can be matched against what was actually passed rather than merely against
	// "the action ran at some point".
	ArgKey string `json:"arg_key,omitempty"`
	// Unchanged points at the things the answer says were ALREADY correct and
	// needed no work. That is not a neutral non-statement: it claims the thing
	// exists and matches, so nothing was done.
	//
	// It is the more dangerous of the two claims. A false "I created it" leaves
	// the user looking for something that is not there, and they find out. A
	// false "it was already there" tells them their request was satisfied before
	// they asked, and they have no reason to look at all. processo_builder
	// answered a request for test_ask_a by reporting test_scan_a - a different,
	// similarly named field - as unchanged, and told the user they were done.
	//
	// Verified the opposite way round from Claims: these must be PRESENT in the
	// evidence, and an absence is the fault.
	Unchanged string `json:"unchanged,omitempty"`
	// Reject makes an unsupported claim fail the answer. Off by default, and
	// stated as its own flag rather than as a ruleset.Severity on purpose:
	// SeverityError is ruleset's ZERO value, because an undeclared rule there
	// should be a hard one. Claims want the opposite default - the evidence is
	// incomplete, so silence must mean "mark it down", not "reject it" - and
	// reusing a zero value that means the opposite of what you need is how a
	// default quietly becomes the wrong one.

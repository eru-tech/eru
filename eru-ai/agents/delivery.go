// The delivery seal: what the loop judged is what the caller receives.
//
// # The invariant, and why it is the one worth enforcing
//
// Every guard in this framework - the schema, OutputValidator, the quality gate,
// and whatever rules an agent declares in configuration - runs against the
// artifact the loop holds when it decides to stop. None of them means anything
// unless that artifact is the one the caller actually gets.
//
// It was not. An agent type overrides Execute, calls the loop, and is then free
// to rewrite the answer on the way out; the framework has already finished and
// never looks again. In a live run this produced two log lines five seconds
// apart - the validator clearing a page that bound no queries, and the delivery
// path handing over a page bound to a query that does not exist. A green
// validation meant the agent had written something acceptable at some point, not
// that anyone received it.
//
// # Why a seal rather than more hooks
//
// The obvious fix is a "finalizer" capability: a declared place for an agent
// type to shape its answer, running before validation. The framework already has
// one - OutputNormalizer - and eru_studio already uses it. A second hook with
// the same semantics would add surface without adding a guarantee, because
// nothing would stop the next agent type doing its shaping somewhere else again.
//
// Three things have to hold for a verdict to be worth anything:
//
//	a. what is judged is what is delivered
//	b. everything that shapes the artifact happens before judgement
//	c. content produced by sub-agents is itself judged
//
// They look like three jobs and they are one. Enforce (a) and the other two stop
// needing to be policed: shaping that happens late breaks the seal, and a
// sub-agent's page merged in after the fact breaks the seal. Both become
// failures that report themselves, at the moment they happen, naming the agent
// that did it. That is the whole argument for doing this instead of adding
// capabilities - an invariant catches the cases nobody thought of, and a hook
// only catches the ones someone remembered to route through it.
//
// # What an agent type is still allowed to do
//
// Plenty. Transforming the answer after the loop is legitimate - resolving an
// envelope, stamping an identity, merging pages built elsewhere. It just has to
// go through DeliverTransformed, which re-runs the agent's own validator on the
// result. That costs no model call and refuses exactly one thing: a transform
// that introduces a fault the loop would have rejected.

// Seal is a fingerprint of the artifact the loop validated.
//
// It is carried on the message rather than in the context because the context
// belongs to the caller: an agent type builds its own ctx before calling the
// loop, so the loop cannot write a value back into it. The message is the one
// thing that definitely travels from the loop to the caller.

// The transform is applied, the agent's own validator is re-run on the result,

//
// An agent type with no OutputValidator gets the reseal and nothing else, which
// is the correct amount of checking for an agent that declares no rules.
//
// # Why this refuses and VerifyDelivery only reports
//
// The two are at different moments and the difference is real. Here the agent
// type is ASKING the framework to sanction a change, before anything has been
// handed over: refusing costs the request, and the alternative is knowingly
// shipping an artifact that fails the agent's own rules. A user who asked for a
// dashboard is better served by an error they can act on than by a page that
// renders nothing behind a 200 - that silent blank is the failure this whole
// harness was started over.
//
// VerifyDelivery runs at the boundary, where the answer is already out. There,
// refusing would turn a reporting problem into an outage, so it says so loudly
// and lets it through.
// OnFault says what a transform's author wants done if the result no longer
// passes.
//
// The distinction is whether the user will be told. The seal exists to stop
// work being handed over that nothing checked; a fault the answer itself
// discloses has been checked and reported, and the decision to ship it anyway
// belongs to the agent type that made it.
//
// eru_studio's page composer is the case that forced this. It builds a nested
// page, checks it, retries, and if it still has a flaw attaches it WITH a
// warning - on the stated grounds that a flawed card page beats a mount
// pointing at nothing. Refusing that would override a deliberate and visible
// product decision, and turn a page with one imperfection into an error.

// What calling a tool does, and what the framework does about it.
//
// # The bug class this closes
//
// The inner loop retries. That is the whole point of it: an answer is rejected,
// the reason goes back, the agent tries again. But the agent does not only
// produce an answer - it calls tools, and some of those tools WRITE. An agent
// that saved an entity, then had its report rejected for a missing key, will
// very often save the entity again on the retry. Nothing stopped it. The user
// asked for one entity and got three, one per attempt, and every check passed
// because the final report was perfectly well formed.
//
// This is not hypothetical and it is not rare. It is the direct consequence of
// combining a retry loop with tools that have side effects, which is what every
// useful agent is.
//
// # Why the framework has to know, rather than the agent being careful
//
// "The agent should not call it twice" is a prompt, and prompts are advice. The
// framework is the only thing that sees both attempts, so it is the only thing
// that can tell the second call from the first. An annotation is how a tool says
// what it is, and the guard below is the framework acting on it.
//
// Declaring nothing means nothing changes: an unannotated tool is called exactly
// as before, because a framework that silently starts suppressing calls is worse
// than one that duplicates them.

// ToolEffect declares what calling a tool does.
type ToolEffect struct {
	// ReadOnly says the call changes nothing. A lookup, a probe, a list.
	ReadOnly bool `json:"read_only,omitempty"`
	// Destructive says the call removes or overwrites something that was there.
	// Nothing in the framework acts on this yet; it is declared because the
	// question "which of these tools can lose data" should be answerable from
	// configuration rather than by reading Go.
	Destructive bool `json:"destructive,omitempty"`
	// Idempotent says calling twice with the same arguments has the same effect
	// as calling once - a save keyed by id, a set rather than an append. Such a
	// tool is safe to repeat and is never suppressed.
	Idempotent bool `json:"idempotent,omitempty"`
}

// Whether an effect was DECLARED is a separate question from what it says, and
// the answer is the presence of the tool in the effects map rather than a flag
// on the struct. A zero ToolEffect means "nothing was said" and must never read
// as "this writes": the guard below looks the action up, and a miss leaves the
// call alone.

// WriteOnce is the record of side effects already performed in one run.
//
// Keyed on the action and its arguments, because that is what makes two calls
// "the same call" from the outside. Two saves of different entities are two
// pieces of work; two identical saves are one piece of work attempted twice.

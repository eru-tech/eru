// Why a run ended, and what it was allowed to spend getting there.
//
// # The problem with inferring it
//
// The loop had five ways out and no way to tell them apart. "The agent
// finished", "it asked the user something", "it ran out of attempts", "the model
// errored" and "it fell back to an earlier answer" arrived as either a message
// or an error, and anything downstream that cared had to read prose to find out
// which. An eval could assert what the agent DID and never assert that it got to
// the end; a client could not distinguish a paused run from a failed one without
// matching on text; and "it hung" and "it gave up" looked identical from outside.
//
// A closed set fixes that, and it is the prerequisite for anything that wants to
// react to how a run ended rather than only to what it produced.
//
// # And the limit that was not there
//
// RetryCount is an allowance for a specific thing - how many times a REJECTED
// answer may be sent back - and it was doing duty as the loop's only bound. It
// cannot do that job. It says nothing about wall-clock time, nothing about
// tokens, and since the quality gate got its own budget it does not even bound
// the number of trips round the loop. A run could spend an hour and a million
// tokens without crossing a single declared limit.
//
// Budget is the ceiling: separate from RetryCount, checked before each attempt
// rather than after the damage, and reported as a stop reason of its own so
// "stopped because it was told to" is never mistaken for "stopped because it
// finished".

// StopReason is the closed set of ways a run can end.

// An agent's chat memory is already two tiers, and the working set is the first
// of them.
//
// The store an agent is configured with - in process, or Redis - is the
// short-term tier. What persist_enabled and cache_db_alias send on to the
// database is the long-term tier. A row reaches the long-term tier by being
// handed to SyncToDatabase and no other way, so choosing a tier is a matter of
// what a writer does with a row, not of which store it reaches for.
//
// That makes the working set a question of use rather than of plumbing. The
// transcript - role, prose, message id, timestamp - is small, worth keeping, and
// written to both tiers. What a turn CARRIED - the page the client sent as its
// baseline, the params it was invoked with - is far larger than every line of
// prose in a long conversation put together, and is written to the short-term
// tier alone, under the conversation's own key, with a ttl.
//
// Losing it is what makes the second turn of a conversation stupid: "revert the
// label back to what it was" is unanswerable without the page as it stood before
// the last edit, and the only recourse is to ask the user for something they
// have every right to expect us to remember. Keeping it forever buys a great
// deal of storage and very little recall.
//
// So it lives exactly as long as the conversation is warm, in whatever store the
// agent was already configured with. Pointing every instance at one Redis is the
// same configuration change it has always been.

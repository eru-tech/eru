// and every sub-agent callback, each arriving on its own inbound request
// goroutine) only sends here. http.ResponseWriter is not safe for concurrent use:
// two goroutines writing it interleave bytes mid-frame and the client receives
// malformed SSE. Funnelling through this channel keeps that impossible while
// leaving producers non-blocking.
//
// events is never closed, so a producer that raced past the closed check simply
// sends into a queue nobody drains rather than panicking on a closed channel.
